[Last week we discussed how to render elements in React using JSX](/rendering-elements-with-jsx).

This week I want to examine how we can use React's component-based approach to split our UI into separate, reusable pieces.

## What Are React Components?

React components are the building blocks of any React application. Most React applications will be made of many different components composed in many combinations.

At their most basic level components are JavaScript functions that accept arguments, called "props," and return React elements.

```jsx
function FavoriteColor(props) {
  return <h1>My favorite color is {props.favoriteColor}!</h1>
}
```

In this example we've defined a function called `FavoriteColor`.

We capitalize the first letter of the component to indicate to React that we are dealing with a custom component, rather than a DOM tag.

We can pass anything to the component via props - here we are only expecting a `favoriteColor` value.

It is important to note that the props argument is an object containing key/value pairs corresponding to the values passed into the component.

We can then use the value that came in via props in the final h1 React element.

```jsx
function FavoriteColor(props) {
  return <h1>My favorite color is {props.favoriteColor}!</h1>
}

const element = <FavoriteColor favoriteColor="blue" />

ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById("root")) // Assuming we have a DOM element with the id of 'root'
```

What happened in this example?

1. We called `ReactDOM.render()` with the `<FavoriteColor favoriteColor="blue" />` component.
   - Note that we can use `<FavoriteColor />` as a self-closing tag because it doesn't have any children, otherwise we would use opening/closing tags `<FavoriteColor></FavoriteColor>`.
2. React calls the `FavoriteColor` function with `{favoriteColor: 'blue'}` as the props value.
3. Our `FavoriteColor` function returns a `<h1>My favorite color is blue!</h1>` React element as a result.
4. `ReactDOM` updates the DOM to match `<h1>My favorite color is blue!</h1>`.

## Where Do We Use React Components?

In our previous exmaples, we directly passed a React element to `ReactDOM.render()`.

In most React applications we pass an `App` component that serves as a wrapper around our entire application to `ReactDOM`.

By passing our entire application off to `ReactDom` we essentially allow React to deal with efficiently rendering and updating the visual state of our application.

The `App` component will usually contain many different components that all deal with rendering different pieces of our UI.

We can nest components as deep as we'd like.

```jsx
function FavoriteColor(props) {
  return <h1>My favorite color is {props.favoriteColor}!</h1>
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <FavoriteColor favoriteColor="red" />
      <FavoriteColor favoriteColor="green" />
      <FavoriteColor favoriteColor="blue" />
    </div>
  )
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"))
```

Now, what is going on in this example?

1. We again called `ReactDOM.render()` , this time passing the `<App />` component.
2. React calls the `<App />` function.
3. As part of the `<App />` function's execution, each of the child `<FavoriteColor />` functions are executed.
4. This time we're passing different props to each call to `<FavoriteColor />`, each returning a React element with a different value for `props.favoriteColor`.
5. `ReactDOM` updates the DOM to display the result of all function calls.

This process of nesting components inside of components allows us to compose complex views using small pieces that are easier to reason about.

## Components Are Pure Functions

There is one fundamental [rule](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#props-are-read-only) of React components:

> All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props

[Pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) have two properties:

1. They always return the same value when given the same arguments.
2. Their evaluation has no side effects.

In practice this means that React components _must never modify their props._

But, we know that modern UIs are dynamic. How are we supposed to display dynamic data using _read-only_ values coming in as props?

Next we will cover React state, a feature that allows us to change the output of components over time in response to different events
