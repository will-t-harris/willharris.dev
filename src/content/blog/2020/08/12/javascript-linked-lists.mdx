- Series of linked nodes where each node points to the next node in the list. The pointer is the link.
- Each node has a value and a pointer reference to the next node.
- Doubly linked lists have two pointers for each node, one to the next node and one to the previous node.
- Linked lists are LIFO "last in first out." Nodes are added to and deleted from the same end
- Searching for a node in a linked list requires iterating through the list until the node is found. Worst case, this is O(n)

## Downsides of Linked Lists

- To remove a node from a singly-linked list requires iterating through the list and keeping track of the previous node at each iteration until the desired node is found.

## Linked List Methods

- `push(item)`
  - Add an item to the list
- `pop()`
  - Remove an item from the list
- `get(index)`
  - Return an element at a given index, without removing it from the list
- `delete(index)`
  - Delete an element at a given index
- `isEmpty()`
  - Convenience method to check whether the list is empty

## Class-based Singly-Linked List

1. Create a class that represents a Node in the list. Nodes will each have a `value` and a pointer reference to the next node (`next`).
   - **We will assume that the `Node` class is in the same scope as the `LinkedList` class below at all times**

```js
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value
    this.next = null
  }
}
```

2. Create a class that represents our linked list. The class keeps track of three values:
   - `head`: reference to the first item in the linked list
   - `tail`: reference to the last item in the linked list
   - `length`: the number of nodes in the list

```js
class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null
    this.tail = null
    this.length = 0
  }
}
```

3. Create the `isEmpty()` convenience method on the `LinkedList` class which returns `true` if there are no `Node`s in the list

```js
class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null
    this.tail = null
    this.length = 0
  }
  isEmpty() {
    return this.length === 0
  }
}
```

4. Create the `push` method on the `LinkedList` class which deals with adding new items to the list.

- If the list is empty, set the `head` and `tail` to the new `Node` and increment the `length` property by one.

```js
class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null
    this.tail = null
    this.length = 0
  }
  isEmpty() {
    return this.length === 0
  }
  push(value) {
    const newNode = new Node(value)

    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      this.head = newNode
      this.tail = newNode
    }

    this.length++
  }
}
```

- If the list isn't empty, set the current tail's `next` pointer to the new `Node`, set the list's `tail` pointer to the new `Node`, and increment the list's `length` property by one.

```js
class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null
    this.tail = null
    this.length = 0
  }
  isEmpty() {
    return this.length === 0
  }
  push(value) {
    const newNode = new Node(value)

    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      this.head = newNode
      this.tail = newNode
    }

    if (!this.isEmpty()) {
      this.tail.next = newNode
      this.tail = newNode
    }

    this.length++
  }
}
```
