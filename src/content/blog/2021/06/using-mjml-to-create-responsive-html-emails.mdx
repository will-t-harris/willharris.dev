This is an article I wrote while working as a developer at [Yeti](https://yeti.co/). 

It describes how to get started using [mjml](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml) to quickly craft responsive, cross-client compatible HTML emails.

You can read the post on [Yeti's blog](https://yeti.co/blog/using-mjml-to-create-responsive-html-emails/).
